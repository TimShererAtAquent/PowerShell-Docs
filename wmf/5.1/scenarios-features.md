# New Scenarios and Features in WMF 5.1 #

`TODO` Add a brief description of new customer-facing features and scenarios enabled in this release. Depending on the number, we may include more structure to group around particular themes.

`TODO` Keep the description terse and wherever possible link into canonical technical documentation to provide examples/code or required deeper conceptual content.

## Example: PowerShell Editions ##
Starting with version 5.1, PowerShell is available in different editions which denote varying feature sets and platform compatibility.

- **Desktop Edition:** Built on .NET Framework and provides compatibility with scripts and modules targeting versions of PowerShell running on full footprint editions of Windows such as Server Core and Windows Desktop.
- **Core Edition:** Built on .NET Core and provides compatibility with scripts and modules targeting versions of PowerShell running on reduced footprint editions of Windows such as Nano Server and Windows IoT.

- [Filter Get-Module results by CompatiblePSEditions]()
- [Prevent script execution unless run on a comaptible edition of PowerShell]()

## Example: Module Analysis Cache ##
Starting with version 5.1, PowerShell provides the following control
over the file that is used to cache data about a module like the commands it exports.

`TODO` need to either provide a better desription of analysis cache and the 'control' options beyond turning it off/on unless that is the limits to the changes introduced.

By default, this cache is stored in the file `${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleAnalysisCache`.
The cache is typically read at startup while searching for a command
and is written on a background thread sometime after a module is imported.
